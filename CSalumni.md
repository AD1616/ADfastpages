### How did you realize you wanted to do your major and how did CS classes at Del Norte help?

 - CS classes help discover coding skills. It can help develop a love for coding (like with Anthony) or can teach you some new things but put your skills in perspective (like Colin). 
 - Not everyone will like coding (like Mabel). But CS is important for a variety of jobs and internships, and is a key skill for almost everything. So it’s still good to learn!
 - Specifically CSP helps with web design and provides a slight technical background for a CS major (or a cognitive science major and similar things).
 - CS classes can help apply CS to real world problems.
 
### Biggest challenge with CS

 - Starting out is very tough. Google is strong to overcome this.
 - People often have a big ego. Focus on your own path, don’t worry about what others have done. 
 - The theory of computer science is a big shift from programming.
 - Motivation can be difficult, since there’s always someone that is better. Specific projects that apply CS are helpful for this. 
 - The temptation to just do things for points; go above and beyond with stuff.
 - Don’t get caught up planning, and start coding.
 
### PBL in college

 - Two hands-on projects in UCSD. PBL doesn’t go away!
 - In CS major there is lots of PBL. 
 - Not all classes have a strict structure for sprints and stuff.

### How to apply CS if you are not a CS major?	

 - Can use CS to make menial tasks a lot easier and save time. Coding helps with a lot of other tasks too (MATLAB was mentioned). 
 - CS helps a lot with high level math courses.
 - Jupyter notebooks being applied to technical papers.

### Existing college students - have you had a job?

 - Resume is needed. Talk with teachers in college.
 - CS classes help with getting internships. 

# Reflection: 

All of these people were very motivating for me to want to take CS. Some didn’t have much CS experience, but were still able to apply CS skills to various majors; this was cool! It helped me realize that I don’t really have to be the best to be successful in CS. Hand in hand with that idea, things like what Anthony said about following your own path hit home for me. It is definitely something you experience, and it’s good to just accept that there will be people who are better than you; you just have to focus on bettering yourself. The tips about getting a job were also helpful, and I now know that I need to make a good resume and be active on places like Linkedin.
