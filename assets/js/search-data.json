            "title": "Java Anatomy",
            "content": "How does it work? . First, you need to create a class. The name of the class is sometimes called the definition or the header. The keyword at the start determines its access level. Inside of the class, you can create methods, which are like functions. A static method ensures that there is only one of them. The public keyword determines the access level of the method. Void just means that the method doesn&#39;t return anything. . We can then call this method without first instantiating the object, because the method was static. . // Define Static Method within a Class public class HelloStatic { // Java standard runtime entry point public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); } } // A method call allows us to execute code that is wrapped in Class HelloStatic.main(null); // Class prefix allows reference of Static Method . Hello World! . Constructors . A class can have a constructor. This is basically created with the syntax of excluding the &quot;class&quot; keyword. Inside the constructor, you can define and assign variables. Make sure that the variable is defined with an access level and a datatype before it is included in the constructor. . A getter is basically so that you can access variables with the private keyword from outside of the class. It is simply a public method that returns the value of a particular private variable. Note that this is not static, so an object of the class must be created to call this method. . // Define Class with Constructor returning Object public class HelloObject { private String hello; // instance attribute or variable public HelloObject() { // constructor hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; } public String getHello() { // getter, returns value from inside the object return this.hello; // return String from object } public static void main(String[] args) { HelloObject ho = new HelloObject(); // Instance of Class (ho) is an Object via &quot;new HelloObject()&quot; System.out.println(ho.getHello()); // Object allows reference to public methods and data } } // IJava activation HelloObject.main(null); . Hello, World! . Multiple Objects and Constructors . The below class has two constructors. When a class object is created with no parameters, the first constructor is called. When a class object is created with a parameter, the second constructor is called. This allows for a user to access different functionalities of the program based not only on what the values are of the parameters they type but also on what parameters they actually choose to type. . This method also has a getter and a setter for the private hello string. . // Define Class public class HelloDynamic { // name the first letter of class as capitalized, note camel case // instance variable have access modifier (private is most common), data type, and name private String hello; // constructor signature 1, public and zero arguments, constructors do not have return type public HelloDynamic() { // 0 argument constructor this.setHello(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // using setter with static string } // constructor signature, public and one argument public HelloDynamic(String hello) { // 1 argument constructor this.setHello(hello); // using setter with local variable passed into constructor } // setter/mutator, setter have void return type and a parameter public void setHello(String hello) { // setter this.hello = hello; // instance variable on the left, local variable on the right } // getter/accessor, getter used to return private instance variable (encapsulated), return type is String public String getHello() { // getter return this.hello; } // public static void main(String[] args) is signature for main/drivers/tester method // a driver/tester method is singular or called a class method, it is never part of an object public static void main(String[] args) { HelloDynamic hd1 = new HelloDynamic(); // no argument constructor HelloDynamic hd2 = new HelloDynamic(&quot;Hello, Nighthawk Coding Society!&quot;); // one argument constructor System.out.println(hd1.getHello()); // accessing getter System.out.println(hd2.getHello()); } } // IJava activation HelloDynamic.main(null); .

            "content": "Introduction . CS-Students is a sample knowledge graph that can be used to model any classroom that is relation based (a classroom that has lots of different people, pairs, groups, periods; things like that). This notebook is meant to demonstrate how to query this knowledge graph based on the preset things that are currently in the sample data. . Data . Currently, the data consists of the following categories (which are labels in Neo4J): . Period (most teachers would find it useful to have their data divided into class periods) . Scrum Team (basically, the largest overarching groups of students, under period) . Pairs (pairs of students within scrum teams) . Person (object that represents each student) . The data also has the following relationships . IN_PERIOD (to relate teams to the period they are in) . CROSSOVER (a relationship that exists to connect pairs of teams which work together) . PAIR_SHARE (relationship defining students who are paired together) . IN_GROUP (to relate people to the group they are in) . Setup in Anaconda . 1: Install Anaconda . 2: On windows, open the Anaconda command prompt. On mac, open the normal terminal. . 3: Run the following commands: . conda install jupyter . conda install py2neo . conda install pandas . conda install neo4jupyter . 4: If you haven&#39;t already, then clone this repository to a location that you can navigate to easily in your files. . 5: The commands above have configured your conda environment. Now, simply run the command . jupyter notebook . 6: This should open up something in the browser. You will see all of your files. Navigate to the directory which has the github repository clone. . 7: Then, navigate to this notebook. You should be able to run this notebook and experience all of its features now! . Setup in an IDE like VSCode . 1: In the IDE terminal, run the following commands: . pip install jupyter . pip install py2neo . pip install pandas . pip install neo4jupyter . 2: You&#39;re all set to run the notebook! . import pandas as pd import getpass from py2neo import Graph, Node, Relationship from py2neo import GraphService import neo4jupyter neo4jupyter.init_notebook_mode() . # The password is made private. password = getpass.getpass(prompt=&#39;Password: &#39;, stream=None) graph = Graph(&quot;neo4j+ssc://f9708be2.databases.neo4j.io&quot;, auth=(&quot;neo4j&quot;, password)) # database gs = GraphService(&quot;neo4j+ssc://f9708be2.databases.neo4j.io&quot;, auth=(&quot;neo4j&quot;, password)) . neo4jupyter.draw(graph, {&quot;PERSON&quot;: &quot;name&quot;}) . query = &quot;MATCH(n:SCRUM_TEAM) RETURN n.name AS TeamName, n.runtimelink AS RuntimeLink&quot; graph.run(query).to_data_frame() .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | .
