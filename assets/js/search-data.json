            "content": "Introduction . CS-Students is a sample knowledge graph that can be used to model any classroom that is relation based (a classroom that has lots of different people, pairs, groups, periods; things like that). This notebook is meant to demonstrate how to query this knowledge graph based on the preset things that are currently in the sample data. . Data . Currently, the data consists of the following categories (which are labels in Neo4J): . Period (most teachers would find it useful to have their data divided into class periods) . Scrum Team (basically, the largest overarching groups of students, under period) . Pairs (pairs of students within scrum teams) . Person (object that represents each student) . The data also has the following relationships . IN_PERIOD (to relate teams to the period they are in) . CROSSOVER (a relationship that exists to connect pairs of teams which work together) . PAIR_SHARE (relationship defining students who are paired together) . IN_GROUP (to relate people to the group they are in) . Setup in Anaconda . 1: Install Anaconda . 2: On windows, open the Anaconda command prompt. On mac, open the normal terminal. . 3: Run the following commands: . conda install jupyter . conda install py2neo . conda install pandas . conda install neo4jupyter . 4: If you haven&#39;t already, then clone this repository to a location that you can navigate to easily in your files. . 5: The commands above have configured your conda environment. Now, simply run the command . jupyter notebook . 6: This should open up something in the browser. You will see all of your files. Navigate to the directory which has the github repository clone. . 7: Then, navigate to this notebook. You should be able to run this notebook and experience all of its features now! . Setup in an IDE like VSCode . 1: In the IDE terminal, run the following commands: . pip install jupyter . pip install py2neo . pip install pandas . pip install neo4jupyter . 2: You&#39;re all set to run the notebook! . import pandas as pd import getpass from py2neo import Graph, Node, Relationship from py2neo import GraphService import neo4jupyter neo4jupyter.init_notebook_mode() . # The password is made private. password = getpass.getpass(prompt=&#39;Password: &#39;, stream=None) graph = Graph(&quot;neo4j+ssc://f9708be2.databases.neo4j.io&quot;, auth=(&quot;neo4j&quot;, password)) # database gs = GraphService(&quot;neo4j+ssc://f9708be2.databases.neo4j.io&quot;, auth=(&quot;neo4j&quot;, password)) . neo4jupyter.draw(graph, {&quot;PERSON&quot;: &quot;name&quot;}) . query = &quot;MATCH(n:SCRUM_TEAM) RETURN n.name AS TeamName, n.runtimelink AS RuntimeLink&quot; graph.run(query).to_data_frame() .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .
