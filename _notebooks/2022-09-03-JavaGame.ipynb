    "\n",
    "Here we only use the built in Java libraries AWT and Swing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We create 4 classes. One class contains the game loop, and manages the game. A game loop essentially runs every couple of miliseconds to update the game state. Another class contains the player controller, which is how you can move around and jump. One class draws the ground, and the other class is for the obstacle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new directory for all of the java files, so that they can be part of the same package. The reason that this isn't done in a Notebook is because the classes depend on each other, so individual cells containing classes won't be able to run. \n",
