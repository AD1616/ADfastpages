    "\n",
    "Control Structures control the flow of a program. They determine what and when segments of code are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of control structures: conditionals and iteratatives. Conditionals consist of if/else statements, which execute a code segment based on if a condition has been met. In iteration, we mainly use for loops and while loops, which repeat the code segment inside of the loop until a certain condition has been met. \n",
    "\n",
    "All control structures make heavy use of booleans and boolean expressions."
